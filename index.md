A project activity for [Girls Into Coding](https://www.girlsintocoding.com/).


This session is designed to be fun! The idea is that we can follow it together online, but that we can be free to move at our own pace. We're going to be doing some basic python programming in this activity. If you're not too familiar with Python, don't worry, you'll be able to follow along :) !

# How do you move a robot arm?
<div id="Explanation">
</div>
<br>


Say you'd like to build a robot. And of course, robots have to move, otherwise they can't do much! 

What can you use to move your robot?
Do you have any ideas?
Think about things that move, what makes them move?

<br>

<br>

**Motors** are an easy way to get moving! They can be quite affordable and electrical motors can be powered by batteries, which are a convenient power source. In fact, I've just packed some for you in the box!

Have a look at the box, and pull out the bags labelled "Servomotor" and "Stepper Motor".

They look like this:

<br>
<!--Insert photo-->
![MapExample](images/Map.png)

<br>

These are two different types of motors, and we're going to learn all about them today.
<br>
<br>

## How do you make battery power turn into movement?
<br>

Using magnets!

What do you remember about magnets and how they behave? Let's pause a moment to have a think about it.

<br>

Have an idea? Cool. Let's crack on!

Have you tried making an **electromagnet** using a coil of wire and a battery? Here's a helpful link if you want to try it at home!

[How to make an electromagnet](https://sciencebob.com/make-an-electromagnet/)

If you run an electrical current through a wire (for example, with a battery!), it will generate an **electromagnetic field** around the wire. Making lots of coils magnifies this effect, so we usually make electromagnets using coils. These are magnets that you can turn on and off, or even switch polarities! This is compared to permanent magnets, which you might have seen around.

<br>
<img src="images/Explanation/magnet-set_1308-15311.jpg" alt="Magnets" class="center" height="300"/>

*Image Copyright [brgfx](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/magnet-set_2480989.htm)*

<p style="text-align: center;">Permanent magnets look like these!</p>
<br>


Inside every motor there is a permanent magnet and there is an electromagnet. 

What happens when you point the North end of a magnet to the South end of a magnet?

They try to get away from each other of course! Their electromagnetic fields interact with each other, generating a force. This force is what we use to make the motor turn! We can observe this phenomenon in the animation in this link: [DC Motor animation](https://nationalmaglab.org/education/magnet-academy/watch-play/interactive/dc-motor)

Open it and let the applet load. It should look like this:

<img src="images/Explanation/DC_Motor_animation.jpg" alt="DC Motor Explanation screenshot"
	title="DC Motor Demonstration" height="280" class="center"/>

Have a play with the speed and pay attention to the little green arrows. They show the direction in which the electromagnetic force pushes the coil. In this animation, the outer magnet is the permanent magnet, and the coil in the middle connected to the battery is the electromagnet. The part that moves is connected to the **shaft** of the motor, which you can attach things to that need to be moved. All electric motors use this principle.

Now let's take a look at the motors we have right now and learn more about them!

<br>
<br>


# Let's play with some motors!
---

## The Servomotor
<br>

The servomotor you have with you is a very common hobby servomotor, sometimes shortened to 'servo'. It has a permanent magnet and an electromagnet inside, and a gearbox. The gearbox helps to increase the torque (the turning force) of the motor, while slowing down its speed. It also has a sensor that can measure its rotation!

Being able to measure how much it has rotated helps it to decide how much to continue moving, which is nice because it means you don't have to add extra things to control the motor and make it go to the position you want, which is useful for robotic applications. It is also very light and compact.

Take it out of the bag and let's have a look at the motor.
<br>

<!-- image of servomotor parts-->
<img src="images/AssemblyServo/Servomotor_Parts.png" alt="Servomotor Parts" class="center"/> 

<br>
You can see the shaft of the motor on the outside, and through the plastic body you can see the plastic gears inside. At the bottom of the motor, you can see a controller board and there are three wires coming out of the body of the motor.

The <span style="color:Brown">brown wire</span> is connected to the ground of the power supply, the <span style="color:Red">red wire</span> is connected to the positive end of the power supply, and the <span style="color:DarkOrange">yellow wire</span> will be used to give the control signal to the servomotor. The control signal is what we will give to the motor controller board to tell it what position we want the servomotor to go to.

You can easily get motor driver boards to control a servomotor, or control them using a microcontroller board like an Arduino or a microbit. All you need is to be able to provide electrical power to the electromagnetic coil, and a control signal. Today we will be using the microbit and a robotics board!

        Slot the servomotor into the robot arm base on the base board as shown in the photo. It is a snap joint, so all you need to do is put one end of the motor attachment tab into one slot on the motor base, and then gently press in the other end of the motor attachment into the other slot on the motor base until it 'snaps' in.

        Make sure that the shaft of the servomotor is in the middle of the two ends, and is facing up towards the ceiling.

        Make sure the battery holder is switched off.

        Take the robot arm and push it onto the shaft of the servomotor firmly, as shown in the photo.

        We then need to make sure that the position of the arm is correct. Gently use the arm to turn it all the way to the right, until it won't move anymore. Don't use too much force! We don't want to break the motor, we just want to move the shaft into position.

        Once the robot arm doesn't move anymore, pull it off, and put the robot arm so that it faces the right. This way, when your arm is at zero position, it should be pointing to the left, as shown in the photo.

        Once you're done with that, we're ready to start programming!

Whenever we're building a robot (or anything) it's really important to test it works in stages! We've just put our first motor together, so now lets test that it works :)! Follow these instructions to check your motor is moving correctly!

      It can be really hard to see whether a motor shaft is moving unless we attach something to it. So let's do that now. <br> <br> Take the robot arm #1 and place it so that the small 'D' shape in the green part of the robot arm lines up with the motor shaft. You should be able to push the two together gently. Now give the robot arm a gentle turn to check it rotates. <br>

        You should see the microbit start up with a picture of a snake! That's how you know you've got the right code. It will then display the motor number which is currently being controlled (number 1). To test the motor press either the A or B button. This will move the motor anticlockwise (A) or clockwise (B) by 15 degrees.

## Joints and Grids

I'm going to introduce some new terms!

When we work with certain robots, we like to talk about the **Joint Space** and the **Cartesian Space**. They're just two ways of describing where our robot is, or its **state**. I'll show you in a bit what these terms mean, but first I'll show you where Forward and Inverse Kinematics fits into all this. I'll come back to this diagram later and you'll understand it better.

<br>

![JointtoCartesian](images/JointCartesianChart.png)

<br>
<br>

# Let's try moving in the Joint Space!

<br>

When we talk about **Joint Space**, we are describing what each joint of the robot is doing. Joints are places where the robot can move, and usually connect two rigid bodies. We use **joints** and **links** to try and simplify the mathematics we need to do.

A good example of this is our own human arm! If I were to make a very simple drawing of how my arm moves, I'd have a shoulder joint, an elbow joint, and a wrist joint. The bones in between are links.

<br>

![ArmJoint](images/ArmJoints.png)

<br>

If you observe our robot arm, it uses **revolute joints**. These are joints that only rotate, a bit like like the hinges in your room door! 


<br>

We've made a little animation that you can use to try and understand what it means to control the robot in joint space. 

<br>

<p class="codepen" data-height="734" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="benisme" data-slug-hash="BapYoKB" style="height: 734px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Robot arm (Joint Angles v1)">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/benisme/pen/BapYoKB">
  Robot arm (Joint Angles v1)</a> by Ben (<a href="https://codepen.io/benisme">@benisme</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<br> 

Have a play around with it, and see if you can understand what values you can give the joint, and what it will make the joint do!

The picture below might help you understand what the values mean for a more complex robot. The black lines indicate where 'zero' is for that joint, and I've put down the direction that are positive values.

<br>

![JointsInfo](images/Joints_info.png) <!-- Have to replace this -->

<br>

# What about Cartesian Space?

<div id="Activity6" class="container p-3 my-3 bg-primary text-primary">
<h2>Activity #6</h2>
</div>

<br>

After playing about with the **Joint Space**, maybe you're getting the hang of it. Now just imagine if you had a robot with *lots more joints*! Like *twenty*. What about robots like these?

![Complexrobots](images/complexrobots.png)
*Images Copyright [Acrome Robotics](https://acrome.net/)*

<br>

That's a lot of joints you'd have to control! It wouldn't be easy using joint space alone.

Now I'm going to introduce you to **Cartesian Space**. You might have heard of things like **coordinates**. Coordinates are a way of talking about the position of things, and Cartesian is a system of coordinates. If you know maps, you'll have heard of longitude and latitude, it's a bit like that.

The **Cartesian coordinate system** in 2-dimensions (a flat surface!) uses 2 axes: x and y to describe where a point is on that plane. For example, in the image below the cat is at x = 2 and y = 3. Or we can write it as (2, 3) with brackets. So if I told you to put the cat at (2, -3), where would I put it?

<br>

![CoordinateCat](images/Coordinates.png)
*Cat Image Copyright of [Irasutoya](https://www.irasutoya.com)*

<br>

Okay, so now you have the idea. Here is an image of the robot and a grid over it, with **x** and **y** axis measurements. Any point within the pink area (also called the workspace) is a place the end of the robot can reach.

<br>

![YoubotCoords-nobox](images/YoubotCoordinates-nobox.png)

<br>

This is exactly the same as for our simple robot arm!

        Next touch the microbit logo button, the robot arm should move to the approximate position x = 5, y = 5.

        <ul>
        <li>If you didn't see the picture of the ghost, something is wrong with the software! -> Check your code!</li>
        <li>If your robot arm isn't moving then there maybe something wrong with your connections! -> Check your battery is switched on and check all your wires are securely in their connections (give them a gentle tug).</li>
        <li>If you accidently press the a or b button, the code will move the arm to a different position, we don't want this at the moment. So if you do do that just press the resest button on the microbit and try again! :) </li>
        <li>If your microbit seems unresponsive, then just try to give the reset button a push and see if that helps!</li>

        If you touch either the a or b button you will notice that you can input the desired position of the robot arm. The a button increases the y value by 1, and the b button increases the x button by 1.
        <br>
        When you want the robot arm to move to the desired position then you press the microbit logo!
        <br>
        Try and program the robot arm by pressing the buttons (Tip: you need to press the b button), to move to the position x = 7 and y = 5 so that it touches the flower that we've just drawn.

        Try and pick another position near to the flower and get your arm to move there by programming in the grid co-ordinates. Note that our arm is a low cost version and it's performance isn't brilliant! But hopefully you can see it move to the approximate position!! :) .
        <br>
        Sometimes you might get the message on the microbit that the arm can't reach a position. This will happen if you input co-ordinates that are impossible for the arm to reach!! (Because of it's geometry)

This is why we use kinematics. It can be hard to imagine in our heads what the end of the robot might do if we changed the position of a joint. **Forward Kinematics** can help us change our joint positions to **Cartesian space**, which can be a lot easier to visualise. If we know a point in **Cartesian space** we want to get to, we can use **Inverse Kinematics** to find the joint positions we need to give our robot.

This is a really simplified problem with a robot arm, but we use the same principles when we're trying to figure out where a car is, or even flying robots. We used **trigonometry** and **geometry** to do this. 

What else do you think this might be useful for?
