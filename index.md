A project activity for [Girls Into Coding](https://www.girlsintocoding.com/).


This session is designed to be fun! The idea is that we can follow it together online, but that we can be free to move at our own pace. We're going to be doing some basic python programming in this activity. If you're not too familiar with Python, don't worry, you'll be able to follow along :) !

# How do you move a robot arm?
<div id="Explanation">
</div>
<br>


Say you'd like to build a robot. And of course, robots have to move, otherwise they can't do much! 

What can you use to move your robot?
Do you have any ideas?
Think about things that move, what makes them move?

<br>

<br>

**Motors** are an easy way to get moving! They can be quite affordable and electrical motors can be powered by batteries, which are a convenient power source. In fact, I've just packed some for you in the box!

Have a look at the box, and pull out the bags labelled "Servomotor" and "Stepper Motor".

They look like this:

<br>
<!--Insert photo-->

<br>

These are two different types of motors, and we're going to learn all about them today.
<br>
<br>

## How do you make battery power turn into movement?
<br>

Using magnets!

What do you remember about magnets and how they behave? Let's pause a moment to have a think about it.

<br>

Have an idea? Cool. Let's crack on!

Have you tried making an **electromagnet** using a coil of wire and a battery? Here's a helpful link if you want to try it at home!

[How to make an electromagnet](https://sciencebob.com/make-an-electromagnet/)

If you run an electrical current through a wire (for example, with a battery!), it will generate an **electromagnetic field** around the wire. Making lots of coils magnifies this effect, so we usually make electromagnets using coils. These are magnets that you can turn on and off, or even switch polarities! This is compared to permanent magnets, which you might have seen around.

<br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/Explanation/magnet-set_1308-15311.jpg" alt="Magnets" height="300" class="center"></p>

*Image Copyright [brgfx](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/magnet-set_2480989.htm)*

<p style="text-align: center;">Permanent magnets look like these!</p>
<br>


Inside every motor there is a permanent magnet and there is an electromagnet. 

What happens when you point the North end of a magnet to the South end of a magnet?

They try to get away from each other of course! Their electromagnetic fields interact with each other, generating a force. This force is what we use to make the motor turn! We can observe this phenomenon in the animation in this link: [DC Motor animation](https://nationalmaglab.org/education/magnet-academy/watch-play/interactive/dc-motor)

Open it and let the applet load. It should look like this:

<img src="images/Explanation/DC_Motor_animation.jpg" alt="DC Motor Explanation screenshot"
	title="DC Motor Demonstration" height="280" class="center">

Have a play with the speed and pay attention to the little green arrows. They show the direction in which the electromagnetic force pushes the coil. In this animation, the outer magnet is the permanent magnet, and the coil in the middle connected to the battery is the electromagnet. The part that moves is connected to the **shaft** of the motor, which you can attach things to that need to be moved. All electric motors use this principle.

Now let's take a look at the motors we have right now and learn more about them!

<br>
<br>


# Let's play with some motors!
---

## The Servomotor
<br>

The servomotor you have with you is a very common hobby servomotor, sometimes shortened to 'servo'. It has a permanent magnet and an electromagnet inside arranged like the animation we looked at before, and a gearbox. The gearbox helps to increase the torque (the turning force) of the motor, while slowing down its speed. It also has a sensor that can measure its rotation!

Being able to measure how much it has rotated helps it to decide how much to continue moving, which is nice because it means you don't have to add extra things to control the motor and make it go to the position you want. This can be useful for robotic applications. It is also very light and compact.

Take it out of the bag and let's have a look at the motor.
<br>

<!-- image of servomotor parts-->
<img src="images/AssemblyServo/Servomotor_Parts.png" alt="Servomotor Parts" class="center"/> 

<br>
You can see the shaft of the motor on the outside, and through the plastic body you can see the plastic gears inside. At the bottom of the motor, you can see a controller board and there are three wires coming out of the body of the motor.

The <span style="color:Brown">brown wire</span> is connected to the ground of the power supply, the <span style="color:Red">red wire</span> is connected to the positive end of the power supply, and the <span style="color:DarkOrange">yellow wire</span> will be used to give the control signal to the servomotor. The control signal is what we will give to the motor controller board to tell it what position we want the servomotor to go to.

For servomotors, the control signal is just how long you turn on the current in one second. This is called *Pulse Width Modulation*. The signal would look like this:

<br>
<img src="images/Explanation/servo-rotation.gif" alt="PWM-Angularposition" class="center"/>

*Image copyright [Apoorve](https://circuitdigest.com/article/servo-motor-working-and-basics#:~:text=Servo%20motor%20works%20on%20PWM,(potentiometer)%20and%20some%20gears.)*
<br>

The servomotor we have can go from 0 degrees to 180 degrees. You can get servomotors that can move in bigger angles, or even continuously, like normal motors! For our motor, if the current is turned on for a shorter amount of time, the angular position will be smaller. To get a larger angular position, the current should be turned on for a longer amount of time.

You can easily get motor driver boards to control a servomotor, or control them using a microcontroller board like an Arduino or a microbit. All you need is to be able to provide electrical power to the electromagnetic coil, and a control signal. Today we will be using the microbit and a robotics board!

        Slot the servomotor into the robot arm base on the base board as shown in the photo. It is a snap joint, so all you need to do is put one end of the motor attachment tab into one slot on the motor base, and then gently press in the other end of the motor attachment into the other slot on the motor base until it 'snaps' in.

        Make sure that the shaft of the servomotor is in the middle of the two ends, and is facing up towards the ceiling.

        <p>Were you able to tell whether the motor moved? It might have made a sound, but it is hard to tell how far the motor moved. This is where the motor arm comes in handy. Push the motor arm back on so it points to the right. So now we know that both the motor and the arm is pointing to zero degrees.</p>

        <p>All this stuff at the beginning, that's code for setting up the robotics board so our microbit can communicate with it and then use it to send signals to the motors.</p>
        <p>This bit over here, these are <b>functions</b> that can be used for common commands to the motors. It's a bit complicated, but you can think of it as a set of instructions that you would use very often, so you write a function so you won't have to type up the whole thing over and over again!</p> 
        <p>This first bit of code you've been given just sets the motor to zero, which is what we used to zero the arm. I've given you a headstart! Look carefully at the function call that sets the motor to zero, and see if you can make the motor do something else when you press the A button or the B button.</p>

## The Stepper Motor 
<br>

Now that we've looked at a servomotor, what it looks like, how you connect it and how you make it move, let's do the same for the stepper motor. The stepper motor we've given you in the kit is a miniature unipolar stepper motor. Just like the servomotor, it has a permanent magnet, electromagnets and a gearbox inside. The gearbox for the stepper motor also helps to increase the torque of the motor while reducing how fast it moves. However, the difference is that instead of the electromagnet rotating, the permanent magnet rotates instead! That means the permanent magnet is connected to the shaft.

<br>

Electromagnet coils are placed around the permanent magnet in the middle, as shown in the figure below. By activating each coil in sequence, the the permanent magnet in the middle will rotate.

<br>
<img src="images/Explanation/Working-Principle02.webp" alt="Stepper Motor Working Principle" class="center">

<br>

As you can see from the animation, the permanent magnet moves in **steps**, which is why it's called a stepper motor! These types of motors have very good positional control, and are very good at holding their position. You don't really need a sensor in order to make it turn a certain amount, since you can just count the number of steps. But if you control it by moving a certain amount of steps, it won't actually know where you started! So you need to move it to its starting position before you turn on the motor and control program.

This is in comparison to the servomotor, which knows what position it is at even if you turn off the motor, but is slightly worse at holding that position.

Let's take the stepper motor out of its bag and have a look at it.

<br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/Explanation/Working-Principle02.webp"></p>

You can see the body of the motor, where the coils and magnet are. The shaft of the motor sticks out from the 3D printed attachment, and the attachment is covering the gearbox. This is so that dirt won't get in, which can mess with how it moves! There are four wires coming out from the body of the motor. These connect to the electromagnet coils.

Now that we know a bit about our stepper motor, let's try and make it move!
